# Plan: Next.js Storefront Client Document

## Summary
Prepare a comprehensive document outlining how to implement the storefront client-side using Next.js so that storefront customers can browse, purchase, and fulfill orders end-to-end.

## Steps
1. Review existing storefront/back-office docs to capture constraints, terminology, and integration requirements.
2. Define the document structure covering architecture, routing approach, data access, and order fulfillment flows.
3. Enumerate the required Next.js pages, their responsibilities, and interactions needed for customers to place and manage orders.
4. Describe implementation approaches for shared concerns (state management, API communication, authentication, SSR/ISR choices, performance, observability).
5. Proofread and ensure the document gives actionable guidance, aligning terminology with the broader project before delivering it.

## Open Questions
- Do you have a preferred target location/filename for the new document?
- Should the document assume any existing component libraries or design systems?
