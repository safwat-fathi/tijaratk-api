# ✅ **Tijaratk Order Plan**

### _(Catalog Orders + Custom Orders + Guest Customers + WhatsApp Magic Links)_

This document defines the **complete order lifecycle and actions model** in Tijaratk, designed for:

- Facebook / Instagram / WhatsApp commerce
- Omnichannel Inbox workflows
- Guest-first ordering
- COD-only payments (Phase 1)
- Minimal friction & minimal refactoring

---

## 🧩 **1. Order Types**

| Order Type        | Description                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Catalog Order** | Created from existing products ✅ [Implemented]                                          |
| **Custom Order**  | Created after seller approves a customer request for a non-catalog item |

> **Custom Orders are negotiated first, then converted into Orders**
> They are **not products** and do **not affect catalog or inventory logic**.

---

## 👤 **2. Customer Identity Model**

### 2.1 Registered Customer

- Has account
- Orders linked to `customer_id`

### 2.2 Guest Customer (MVP – Fully Supported)

> **A guest is an identity, not an account**

### ✅ Guest Requirements (Mandatory)

- **WhatsApp number (required)**
- OTP verification (once)

```ts
guest {
  id
  whatsapp_number   // required
  verified_at
}
```

Orders & requests reference:

```ts
order {
  customer_id?   // registered
  guest_id?      // guest
}
```

Applies to:

- `orders`
- `custom_order_requests`
- `custom_order_quotes`

---

## 🔐 **3. Guest Access via WhatsApp Magic Links (Deferred to Phase 3)**

> **The link itself is the authentication**

Guests manage orders **without login** using **secure WhatsApp URLs**.

### 3.1 How It Works

1. Guest places catalog order OR requests custom order
2. System sends WhatsApp message with secure URL
3. Guest clicks link
4. Backend validates token
5. Guest lands on order page (track / update)

---

### 3.2 Token Model

```ts
order_access_token {
  id
  order_id
  guest_id
  token_hash        // stored hashed
  scope             // view | update
  expires_at
  revoked_at?
}
```

- Tokens are **single-order**
- Time-limited
- Revocable

---

### 3.3 Allowed Guest Actions via Link

✅ View order details
✅ Track order status
✅ View shipment info
✅ Request address change
✅ Request cancellation (if allowed)
✅ Contact seller

❌ No price edits
❌ No item edits
❌ No access to other orders

---

### 3.4 Expiration & Recovery

| Case                  | Rule                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Default link validity | 24 hours                   |
| Expired link          | New link sent via WhatsApp |
| Suspicious activity   | Token revoked              |

Guests can always request:

> “Resend order link”

---
