# **3. Detailed Plan Descriptions (Updated with Theme Customization)**

---

## **3.1 Free Plan (MVP)**

The Free Plan provides a **starting point** for small and new sellers.

### ❌ What Free Plan *cannot* do:

### UX Purpose

The Free Plan:

* Let users achieve a **decent-looking store quickly**
* But keep strong incentives to upgrade
* Works great for beginners, but visually limited

---

## **3.2 Pro Plan ($15/month)**

Pro is the MVP’s **premium tier**, offering full store branding.

### ⭐ What Pro adds:

* **Unlimited products**
* **50 Facebook posts per month** (immediate or scheduled, can be linked to products)
* **3,000 inbox messages per month**
* **10 professional themes** (full-theme switching)

### Theme System in Pro:

Pro unlocks:

1. **10 full store themes**
2. Full typography selection per theme
3. Header & footer customization
4. Hero banner & sections configuration
5. Color palette picker
6. Basic custom CSS (optional)

The store becomes fully *brandable*.

---

## **3.3 Enterprise (NOT included in MVP – Coming Phase 2)**

Enterprise is kept in the roadmap but is **not implemented in Phase 1**.

### Enterprise Will Add (in Phase 2):

* WhatsApp Business API inbox
* Unlimited messages
* Up to 10 staff users
* ERP/POS integrations
* Abandoned cart recovery
* Advanced theme builder
* Multi-domain support

### Not part of MVP

Do **not** show Enterprise features in the UI beyond “Coming Soon”.

---

# **4. Add-ons (Updated)**

Add-ons help Free Plan users scale without committing to Pro immediately.

---

## **4.1 Extra Message Pack — $2.50 / 100 messages**

### Purpose:

Free users hit 50 messages extremely fast → add-on unblocks their inbox immediately.

### What it gives:

* +100 messages added to monthly limit
* Can buy multiple packs
* Instant unlock

---

## **4.2 Extra Staff Seat — $5/month**

### Purpose:

Free users often need **one helper**.

### What it gives:

* +1 staff member
* Recurring monthly fee

---

## **4.3 Extra Products Pack — Recommended: $5 for +25 products**

### Purpose:

Free users get limited to **10 products**, forcing early conversion.

### What it gives:

* +25 products added to limit
* Stackable
* Renews monthly

### Why this works:

* Many sellers want more than 10 products but aren’t yet ready for Pro
* This add-on captures early revenue
* Eventually, they upgrade to Pro for unlimited products + themes

---

## **4.4 Extra Posts Pack — $3 for +50 posts**

### Purpose:

Free users are limited to **5 Facebook posts per month**, and Pro users to **50 posts per month**. This add-on allows users to increase their posting capacity without upgrading their entire plan.

### What it gives:

* +50 Facebook posts added to monthly limit
* Posts can be immediate or scheduled
* Posts can be linked to products
* Renews monthly

### Why this works:

* Active sellers hit posting limits quickly, especially during promotional campaigns
* Allows Free users to scale their social media presence incrementally
* Pro users running heavy campaigns can also benefit
* Captures revenue from high-engagement users

---

## **4.5 AI Bot Add-ons (Phase 2)**

## **4.5 AI Bot Add-ons (Phase 2 – Requires Additional Development)**

AI automation add-ons are powerful tools that enhance communication efficiency and increase sales conversion, but they require deeper technical work and compliance with platform policies. They will be introduced in **Phase 2** after core system stability.

---

### **4.5.1 WhatsApp AI Bot Add-on (Phase 2)**

#### **Purpose:**
Automate customer communication on WhatsApp using AI-powered replies and optional workflows.

#### **What it gives:**
* Instant AI-generated answers to FAQs (delivery, price, availability)
* Product recommendation bot
* Lead qualification
* Optional order-taking flow (TBD)
* Pre-trained workflows or AI-only mode
* Reduced customer service workload

#### **Market Fit:**
WhatsApp is the highest-demand sales channel in Egypt. An AI-powered bot directly addresses merchants' pain points of slow replies and repetitive questions.

#### **Pricing (Suggested for Egyptian Market):**
* **199 EGP/month** (basic)
* **349 EGP/month** (pro version with enhanced capabilities)

#### **Concerns & Risks:**
* WhatsApp API setup complexity and message cost
* Meta policy restrictions
* AI hallucination risks
* Requires strong safety layers
* Not part of MVP — Phase 2 only

#### **Open Questions (To Finalize Before Development):**
1. Should the bot support order-taking, or only Q&A?
2. Should it use store data only, or allow general AI reasoning?
3. Should merchants customize bot tone (Egyptian Arabic, English, etc.)?
4. Should there be a monthly message cap or unlimited usage?
5. Should it support a simple template system or full hybrid rules?

---

### **4.5.2 Facebook Messenger AI Bot Add-on (Phase 2)**

#### **Purpose:**
Provide automated replies to Facebook inbox messages, helping merchants respond faster and reduce workload.

#### **What it gives:**
* AI-powered FAQ replies
* Delivery information automation
* Product inquiry handling
* Lead qualification
* Works seamlessly with the existing Omnichannel Inbox

#### **Market Fit:**
Messenger usage remains strong in Egypt, especially for marketplace sellers, though lower than WhatsApp.

#### **Pricing (Suggested for Egyptian Market):**
* **99 EGP/month**

#### **Concerns & Risks:**
* Must follow Meta’s automated messaging rules
* AI hallucinations must be minimized
* Needs high-quality product + policy data ingestion

#### **Open Questions:**
1. Should merchants be able to enable/disable AI per channel?
2. Should the bot escalate to human agents based on confidence levels?
3. Should responses be restricted to store data only?

---

### **4.5.3 Recommended Release Strategy**

AI Bot add-ons require:
* Integration with WhatsApp Business API (Phase 2 per SRS)
* A robust message pipeline
* A hybrid AI + rules fallback system
* Safety filters and tone control

Therefore:  
➡️ **Both AI Bots are officially part of Phase 2 and must not be exposed in MVP UI except as “Coming Soon”.**
